TODOs


1.  9. Implementera bufferten

2.	Under varje bild ska det stå vilken delay från att bilden tagits till att den visas upp.

3.	11. In the client application, the user should be informed
	clearly about which mode is active and what camera server triggered the
	latest movie mode

4.	3.
	By default the system starts up in mode Idle for all cameras. When
	Movie is detected for one camera, all other cameras should also enter
	mode Movie. This mode remains until the operator decides to enter 
	mode Idle again

5.	15.
	It should be possible via the client (either as part of the GUI or as debug
	options) to enforce synchronous mode as well as asynchronous mode. In
	a similar manner, as when selecting Idle according to item 13, it should
	be possible to enforce both Idle and Movie mode. For normal operation,
	there should be a choice Auto  //WAT?
